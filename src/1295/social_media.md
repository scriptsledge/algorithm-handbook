LeetCode 1295: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits | C++ Solution

Counting digits doesn't always require string conversion or logarithms! 

The Engineering Approach:
By leveraging the problem constraints ($10^5$), we can use a range-based check to determine digit parity in $O(1)$ time per number. This avoids the overhead of more complex operations while maintaining high readability.

How do you handle simple problems with strict performance requirements?

Sometimes the most efficient solution isn't the most generic one—it's the one that leverages specific problem constraints.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 1295 (Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits).

🔹 The Goal
Identify how many numbers in an array have an even count of digits.

🔹 The Solution
We use a "Range-Based" approach to solve this in O(N) time with O(1) space.

• Step 1: Iterate through the array.
• Step 2: Use comparison operators to check if the number falls within even-digit ranges (10-99, 1000-9999, etc.).

This approach avoids the overhead of repeated divisions or string allocations, making it ideal for performance-critical paths.
