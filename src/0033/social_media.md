LeetCode 0033: Search in Rotated Sorted Array | C++ Solution

Ever wondered how to search in a sorted array that's been rotated? The trick is identifying which half is still sorted! 💡

The Engineering Approach:
Instead of a linear scan, we use a modified Binary Search. By checking `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, we can determine which side of the pivot we're on and narrow our search space in O(log N) time.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(log N)
• Space: O(1)

Can you search in O(log N) when the sorted order is broken?

Rotated sorted arrays are a classic interview favorite because they test your ability to adapt standard algorithms like Binary Search to non-trivial constraints.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0033 (Search in Rotated Sorted Array).

🔹 The Goal
Find the index of a target element in an array that has been left-rotated at an unknown pivot.

🔹 The Solution
We use a modified Binary Search approach to solve this in O(log N) time.

• Step 1: Identify which half of the current range is sorted.
• Step 2: Check if the target falls within that sorted range to decide where to move our pointers.

This optimization avoids the O(N) linear search, making the algorithm highly efficient for large datasets.
