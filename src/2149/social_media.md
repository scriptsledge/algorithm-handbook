**Title:** LeetCode 2149: Rearrange Array Elements by Sign | C++ Two Pointers Solution

**Description:**
In this engineering breakdown, we explore a stable, linear-time approach to array rearrangement using the Two-Pointer technique.

We prioritize preserving the relative order of elements (stability) while alternating signs, achieving an optimal O(N) time complexity.

*📊 Complexity Analysis*
- Time: O(N) — Single pass processing.
- Space: O(N) — Required for stable rearrangement.

Headline: Preserving Data Stability at Scale: A Linear Time Approach 📉

In data processing pipelines, "stability" isn't just a sorting property—it's often a strict business requirement. When filtering or partitioning streams (like transaction logs or user events), preserving the relative chronological order is critical.

In today's engineering deep dive (LeetCode 2149), we examine the algorithmic pattern for partitioning data sets while maintaining strict stability.

The Challenge:
Rearrange an array to alternate types (Positive/Negative) without disrupting their original relative order.

The Solution:
We implement a Two-Pointer Strategy that operates in O(N) time.
1. Pointer A: Tracks the next available "Positive" slot.
2. Pointer B: Tracks the next available "Negative" slot.

This approach ensures we never need to "shift" elements (which would cost O(N^2)), allowing for predictable performance even on large datasets.
