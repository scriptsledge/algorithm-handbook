**Title:** LeetCode 2149: Rearrange Array Elements by Sign | C++ Two Pointers Solution

**Description:**
In this engineering breakdown, we explore a stable, linear-time approach to array rearrangement using the **Two-Pointer technique**.

We prioritize preserving the relative order of elements (stability) while alternating signs, achieving an optimal O(N) time complexity.

### 📊 Complexity Analysis
*   **Time:** O(N) — Single pass processing.
*   **Space:** O(N) — Required for stable rearrangement.

How do you reorder data without breaking its history? 📉

In data engineering, "Stability" means keeping items in their original relative order. Imagine sorting transaction logs: you want to separate "Credits" from "Debits", but you MUST keep them in chronological order.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 2149.

🔹 The Goal:
Alternate Positive and Negative numbers while strictly preserving their original sequence.

🔹 The Solution:
We use a "Two-Pointer" approach in a single pass (Linear Time).
1. Pointer P: Tracks the next spot for a Positive number.
2. Pointer N: Tracks the next spot for a Negative number.

By pre-calculating the positions, we avoid expensive shifting operations. We sacrifice a bit of memory (Linear Space) to guarantee speed and stability.
