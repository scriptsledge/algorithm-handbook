LeetCode 75: Sort Colors | C++ Solution

Sorting an array of objects in-place without using the built-in sort function! 🚀

The Engineering Approach:
Instead of a naive two-pass counting sort, we optimize for a single pass using the Dutch National Flag algorithm. By maintaining three pointers, we partition the array into 0s, 1s, and 2s in O(N) time and O(1) space.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(N)
• Space: O(1)

How would you sort an array of three distinct values in a single pass?

It sounds simple, but the "Sort Colors" problem (LeetCode 75) is a classic interview question that tests your understanding of pointer manipulation and in-place algorithms.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0075 (Sort Colors).

🔹 The Goal
Sort an array containing only 0, 1, and 2 in-place without using library functions.

🔹 The Solution
We use a "Three Pointers" (Dutch National Flag) approach to solve this in O(N).

• Step 1: Use 'left' and 'right' pointers to track the boundaries of 0s and 2s.
• Step 2: Iterate through the array, swapping 0s to the front and 2s to the back.

This optimization ensures we only visit each element once and use no additional memory.
