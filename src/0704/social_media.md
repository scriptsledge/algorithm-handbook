Title: LeetCode 704: Binary Search | C++ Recursive Solution & Analysis

Description:
Search an element in a sorted array efficiently. We break down the classic Binary Search algorithm using a recursive approach, achieving logarithmic time complexity.

Complexity Analysis
• Time: O(log N)
• Space: O(log N) (due to recursion stack)

LeetCode 704: Binary Search | C++ Solution

How do you find a needle in a haystack if the haystack is sorted? Binary Search is the answer. Instead of checking every element, we halve our search space at every step, making it incredibly fast even for massive datasets.

The Engineering Approach:
By leveraging the sorted property of the array, we compare the target with the middle element and recursively narrow down the search range. This ensures a scalable O(log N) solution.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(log N)
• Space: O(log N)

How do you search through a billion records in just 30 comparisons?

In high-performance systems where low-latency lookups are critical, linear search is rarely an option. If your data is sorted, Binary Search is the gold standard for efficiency.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 704 (Binary Search).

🔹 The Goal
Find the index of a target value in a sorted array with logarithmic time complexity.

🔹 The Solution
We use a "Divide and Conquer" approach to solve this in O(log N).

• Step 1: Identify the middle element of the current range.
• Step 2: Halve the search range based on the comparison between the target and the middle element.

Trade-off: While recursion provides an elegant implementation, it introduces O(log N) space complexity due to the call stack. For memory-constrained environments, an iterative approach would be preferred to achieve O(1) space.
