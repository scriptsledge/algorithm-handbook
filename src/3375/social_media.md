LeetCode 3375: Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to K | C++ Solution

The Engineering Approach:
How do you reach a target state with the fewest possible transitions? 

In this problem, we're restricted to "sinking" the largest identical values in the array. By identifying the unique values strictly greater than our target K, we can calculate the exact number of operations needed without simulating the process step-by-step.

How do you reach a consistent state across a fleet of variables with minimal cost? 📉

In systems engineering, state synchronization often involves constraints on how we can modify values. If we can only decrease the largest set of identical values at once, the number of distinct "high" states determines our operational overhead.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 3375.

🔹 The Goal
Make every element in an array equal to K using the minimum number of "valid" reduction operations.

🔹 The Solution
We use an "Unordered Set" approach to solve this in O(N) time.

• Step 1: Validate that no element is already smaller than K.
• Step 2: Identify all unique elements that are strictly greater than K.
• Step 3: The count of these unique values represents the minimum operations needed.

This approach bypasses simulation entirely, focusing on the fundamental state transitions required to reach convergence.
