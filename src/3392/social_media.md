LeetCode 3392: Count Subarrays of Length Three With a Condition | C++ Solution

Checking sliding windows of size 3.

The Engineering Approach:
We use a single pass O(N) approach. To ensure precision, we use multiplication instead of division (2 * (a + c) == b).

**Prompt:** How do you handle "half of X" in integer comparisons?
- Option 1: x / 2.0
- Option 2: 2 * sum == x
- Option 3: (x % 2 == 0) && (x / 2 == sum)

Efficiency in small constraints: LeetCode 3392.

🔹 The Goal
Count subarrays of length 3 where the first and third elements sum to exactly half of the middle one.

🔹 The Solution
A simple linear scan. We check every possible 3-element window and apply the condition.

🔹 Engineering Tip
When a problem mentions "half", "third", or any fraction, it's often safer to use multiplication to avoid floating-point errors or unnecessary type casting.
