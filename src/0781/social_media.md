LeetCode 0781: Rabbits in Forest | C++ Solution

Can you solve this rabbit riddle? 🐰 We use a frequency map to group rabbits of the same color and minimize the total count.

The Engineering Approach:
By counting how many rabbits gave the same answer, we can calculate the minimum number of color groups required using ceiling division.

Minimum rabbits in a forest? It's all about grouping and ceiling division.

LeetCode 0781 (Rabbits in Forest) is a great problem for practicing greedy logic with hash maps.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0781.

🔹 The Goal
Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest given their answers about same-colored peers.

🔹 The Solution
We use an O(N) approach with a hash map.

• Step 1: Count frequencies of each answer.
• Step 2: For each answer y, calculate how many groups of size y+1 are needed.
• Step 3: Sum the total rabbits across all groups.

This greedy strategy ensures we maximize the number of rabbits sharing the same color.
