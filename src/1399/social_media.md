LeetCode 1399: Count Largest Group | C++ Solution

We explore how to group numbers based on their digit sums and find the distribution of these groups.

The Engineering Approach:
Instead of a naive check, we optimize for digit sum groupings using a frequency-based mapping. This allows for a scalable solution while maintaining code clarity.

How do you efficiently group 10,000 numbers based on their digit sums?

In data partitioning and sharding strategies, we often group items by a property. For LeetCode 1399, we simulate this by grouping numbers by their digit sum to find the largest clusters.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 1399 (Count Largest Group).

🔹 The Goal
The goal is to find the number of digit-sum groups that share the maximum size.

🔹 The Solution
We use a "Frequency Map" approach to solve this in O(N log N).

• Step 1: Iterate through each number and calculate its digit sum.
• Step 2: Track counts in a frequency map and determine which size appears most often.

While an array could suffice due to the small range of digit sums (0-36), a hash map provides a flexible approach that generalizes to larger values.
