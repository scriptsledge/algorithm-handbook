Gardening with algorithms! 🌸

The Engineering Approach:
The problem requires finding a minimum day threshold. Since more days always mean more bloomed flowers, we can use binary search on the range of bloom days. The challenge lies in efficiently counting adjacent flowers to form bouquets.

Monotonicity: The key to optimizing search spaces.

In LeetCode 1482 (Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets), we need to find a minimum day value. 

🔹 The Goal
Form 'm' bouquets of 'k' ADJACENT flowers with minimum wait time.

🔹 The Solution
Binary Search on Answer.

Wait time is monotonic—if you can form the bouquets in 5 days, you can certainly form them in 10. This allows us to search through the "day space" instead of the "flower space."

The check function is a simple linear scan to count contiguous bloomed flowers.
