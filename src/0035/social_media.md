LeetCode 35: Search Insert Position | C++ Solution

Struggling with Binary Search variants? Finding the insertion point is a fundamental pattern you'll see everywhere.

The Engineering Approach:
Instead of a linear search, we use Binary Search to achieve O(log N) efficiency. The key is to track the first position where the element is greater than or equal to the target.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(log N)
• Space: O(1)

How do you find where a value should belong in a sorted list efficiently?

Linear search is O(N), but we can do much better.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 35 (Search Insert Position).

🔹 The Goal
Return the index if the target is found, otherwise return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

🔹 The Solution
We use a Binary Search approach to solve this in O(log N).

• Step 1: Initialize low/high pointers and a position tracker.
• Step 2: Use mid-point comparisons to narrow down the search space.
• Step 3: When nums[mid] >= target, we've found a candidate position and continue searching left.

This pattern is the foundation for functions like lower_bound in C++ or bisect_left in Python.
