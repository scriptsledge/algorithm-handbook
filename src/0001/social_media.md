Title: LeetCode 1: Two Sum | The Power of Hash Maps | C++ Solution

Description:
The "Two Sum" problem is the starting point for thousands of engineers. In this video, we break down why the O(N^2) brute force is inefficient and how we can achieve a linear O(N) solution by trading space for time with an unordered_map.

Complexity Analysis
• Time: O(N)
• Space: O(N)

LeetCode 0001: Two Sum | C++ Solution

The Engineering Approach:
How do you find a needle in a haystack? You don't search the whole stack—you use an index.

In "Two Sum," we trade a small amount of memory for massive speed gains. By using a Hash Map to "remember" numbers we've already seen, we transform a slow O(N²) search into a lightning-fast O(N) single pass.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(N)
• Space: O(N)

How do you optimize a lookup in a high-velocity stream? 📉

In system architecture, "O(N²)" is often a non-starter for production. When you need to find pairs or relations in a dataset, the "Brute Force" way is to check everything against everything. The "Engineering" way is to use a Hash Map.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0001 (Two Sum).

🔹 The Goal
Find two indices in an array whose values add up to a specific target.

🔹 The Solution
We use a "One-Pass Hash Map" approach to solve this in O(N) time.

• Step 1: Iterate through the numbers one by one.
• Step 2: Calculate the "complement" needed to reach the target.
• Step 3: Check our Hash Map to see if we've seen that complement before.
• Step 4: If yes, return the pair. If no, index the current number and continue.

This is the perfect example of a Space-Time Tradeoff: we spend O(N) memory to gain O(N) performance.
