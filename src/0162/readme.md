# 162. Find Peak Element

## Problem Description

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(\log n)$ time.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

### Constraints
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
*   `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
*   `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

## Solution

The solution is implemented in the [`solution.cpp`](./solution.cpp) file.

### Approach

We use **Binary Search** to achieve $O(\log n)$ time complexity. 

The idea is that if an element is smaller than its next neighbor, there must be a peak to its right (as the sequence might continue increasing or eventually decrease). Conversely, if it's larger than its next neighbor, there's a peak at or to its left.

1. Initialize `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`.
2. While `low < high`:
    * Calculate `mid`.
    * If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, move right: `low = mid + 1`.
    * Else, move left (including `mid`): `high = mid`.
3. Return `low`.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1])
                low = mid + 1;
            else
                high = mid;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
```
