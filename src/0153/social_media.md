LeetCode 0153: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array | C++ Solution

Looking for the minimum in a rotated sorted array? Don't settle for O(N)!

The Engineering Approach:
By leveraging the properties of a rotated sorted array, we use Binary Search to find the pivot point in logarithmic time. We always identify which half is sorted and narrow our search accordingly.

Complexity Analysis:
• Time: O(log N)
• Space: O(1)

Can you find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array in better than linear time?

Efficiency is key in technical interviews.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0153 (Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array).

🔹 The Goal
Return the minimum element of a sorted array that has been rotated between 1 and n times.

🔹 The Solution
We use a Binary Search approach to solve this in O(log N).

• Step 1: Identify which half of the current range is sorted.
• Step 2: The minimum of a sorted half is its first element.
• Step 3: Update our global minimum and continue searching the other half.

This approach ensures we never visit more than log(N) elements, making it highly efficient for large datasets.
