LeetCode 0268: Missing Number | C++ Solution

The Engineering Approach:
How do you verify if a sequence is complete without checking every item individually?

Instead of using a Hash Set (which costs O(N) memory), we use the "Summation Checksum" pattern. By calculating the expected sum of the range and subtracting the actual sum, the missing element reveals itself instantly.

How do you verify data integrity in a stream of unique IDs? 📈

In distributed systems or database synchronization, we often need to identify if a single packet or record has been lost. While we could use expensive tracking structures, a simple mathematical checksum is often the most elegant solution.

That is the core challenge of LeetCode 0268 (Missing Number).

🔹 The Goal
Identify the single missing number in a range of [0, n] from an unsorted array.

🔹 The Solution
We use the "Gauss Summation" approach to solve this in linear time.

• Step 1: Calculate the expected sum of the complete range using (n * (n + 1)) / 2.
• Step 2: Calculate the actual sum of the provided array.
• Step 3: The difference between the two is the missing value.

This trades complex search logic for a simple arithmetic check, achieving O(N) runtime with O(1) auxiliary space.
