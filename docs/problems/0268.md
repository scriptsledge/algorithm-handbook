## 📝 Problem Description

!!! info "Problem Statement"
    Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array*.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

### Constraints
*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10^4`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

## 🧠 Intuition

We are looking for a single missing number in a continuous range from $0$ to $n$. 

If the array were complete, the sum of its elements would follow the arithmetic progression formula (Gauss Sum). By calculating this expected sum and subtracting the actual sum of the elements present in the array, the remainder must be the missing number. This is essentially a **checksum** approach.

## 💡 Approach

1.  **Calculate Expected Sum:** The sum of all integers from $0$ to $n$ is given by the formula:
    $$\sum_{i=0}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$
2.  **Calculate Actual Sum:** Iterate through the input array `nums` and compute the sum of its elements.
3.  **Find Missing Number:**
    $$\text{Missing Number} = \text{Expected Sum} - \text{Actual Sum}$$

## 💻 Code

=== "C++"

    ```cpp
    --8<-- "src/0268/solution.cpp"
    ```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
    *   We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.

*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    *   We only use a few integer variables for the sums, regardless of input size.
