## 📝 Problem Description

!!! info "Problem Statement"
    Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return *the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j)` is divisible by `k`*.

### Examples
**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2,2,2,1,3], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are 4 pairs that meet all the requirements:
- nums[0] == nums[6], and 0 * 6 == 0, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[2] == nums[3], and 2 * 3 == 6, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[2] == nums[4], and 2 * 4 == 8, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[3] == nums[4], and 3 * 4 == 12, which is divisible by 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Since no value in nums is repeated, there are no pairs (i,j) that meet all the requirements.
```

### Constraints
*   `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
*   `1 <= nums[i], k <= 100`

## 🧠 Intuition

The problem asks us to find pairs $(i, j)$ such that:
1. $i < j$
2. $nums[i] = nums[j]$
3. $(i \times j) \pmod k = 0$

Since the constraints are very small ($N \le 100$), a brute-force approach checking all pairs would be $O(N^2)$, which is around $10,000$ operations—well within the time limit.

## 💡 Approach

1.  Use a hash map to group indices by their corresponding values in the array.
2.  For each group of indices belonging to the same value:
    *   Iterate through all pairs of indices $(i, j)$ in the group.
    *   Check if $(i \times j)$ is divisible by $k$.
    *   If yes, increment the count.

## 💻 Code

=== "C++"

    ```cpp
    --8<-- "src/2176/solution.cpp"
    ```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N^2)$ in the worst case (when all elements are the same), where $N$ is the length of the array.
*   **Space Complexity:** $O(N)$ to store the indices in the hash map.
