## 📝 Problem Description

!!! info "Problem Statement"
    Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

    The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: `nums = [3,2,3]`
Output: `3`

**Example 2:**
Input: `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`
Output: `2`

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## 🧠 Intuition

The problem asks for an element that appears more than $N/2$ times. 
A brute force approach would be to count the frequency of every element, taking $O(N^2)$ time.
Sorting the array would place the majority element at index $N/2$, taking $O(N \\\log N)$ time.
However, we can do better. The "majority" property is strong: if we cancel out every non-majority element with a majority element, the majority element will still remain. This leads us to the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**.

## 💡 Approach

**Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:**

1.  Maintain a `candidate` variable and a `count` counter.
2.  Iterate through the array:
    *   If `count` drops to 0, we discard the previous candidate and pick the current element as the new `candidate`.
    *   If the current element matches `candidate`, increment `count`.
    *   If it doesn't match, decrement `count` (representing a "cancellation" or "vote against").
3.  Since the majority element appears $>	ext{⌊}n/2	ext{⌋}$ times, it will survive all cancellations and remain as the final `candidate`.

## 💻 Code

=== "C++"

    ```cpp
    --8<-- "src/0169/solution.cpp"
    ```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$
    We iterate through the array exactly once.

*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    We only use two variables (`candidate` and `count`) regardless of the input size.
