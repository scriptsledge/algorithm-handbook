## 📝 Problem Description

!!! info "Problem Statement"
    There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

    Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is possibly left rotated at an unknown index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be left rotated by 3 indices and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

    Given the array `nums` after the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

    You must write an algorithm with $O(\log n)$ runtime complexity.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 0`
- **Output:** `4`

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, `target = 3`
- **Output:** `-1`

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1]`, `target = 0`
- **Output:** `-1`

### Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- $-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4$
- All values of `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- $-10^4 <= target <= 10^4$

## 🧠 Intuition

The standard way to search in a sorted array is Binary Search, which gives $O(\log n)$. Even if the array is rotated, it remains piecewise sorted. Specifically, in any split, at least one half of the array will always be sorted. We can leverage this property to decide which half to explore.

## 💡 Approach

1.  **Modified Binary Search:** Use two pointers, `left` and `right`.
2.  **Determine Sorted Half:** In each step, check if the left half `[left...mid]` is sorted by comparing `nums[left]` and `nums[mid]`.
    -   If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, the left half is sorted.
    -   Otherwise, the right half `[mid...right]` must be sorted.
3.  **Range Check:** Once you identify the sorted half, check if the `target` falls within its bounds.
    -   If it does, narrow your search to that half.
    -   If it doesn't, search the other half.

## 💻 Code

=== "C++"

    ```cpp

    ```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(\log n)$
    -   Since we are using Binary Search, the search space is halved in each iteration.

*   **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$
    -   We only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.
