## 📝 Problem Description

!!! info "Problem Statement"
    You are given an integer `n`.

    We need to group the numbers from `1` to `n` according to the sum of its digits. For example, the numbers `14` and `5` belong to the same group, whereas `13` and `3` belong to different groups.

    Return the number of groups that have the largest size, i.e. the maximum number of elements.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: `n = 13`
Output: `4`
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
There are 4 groups with largest size.

**Example 2:**
Input: `n = 2`
Output: `2`
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.

### Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## 🧠 Intuition

The problem asks us to group numbers based on their digit sums and find how many of these groups share the maximum size. Since $n$ is up to $10^4$, the maximum digit sum is for $9999$, which is $9+9+9+9 = 36$. This is small enough that we can easily use a frequency map or array.

## 💡 Approach

1.  **Iterate and Calculate Digit Sums:** Loop through each number from $1$ to $n$.
2.  **Frequency Map:** For each number, calculate its digit sum and increment the corresponding count in a frequency map (or a small array).
3.  **Find Maximum Size:** After processing all numbers, find the maximum value present in the frequency map.
4.  **Count Groups:** Iterate through the map again (or just the values) and count how many groups have that maximum size.

## 💻 Code

=== "C++"

    ```cpp
    --8<-- "src/1399/solution.cpp"
    ```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

*   **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log_{10} n)$
    We iterate from $1$ to $n$. For each number, we calculate the digit sum, which takes $O(\log_{10} n)$ time (number of digits).

*   **Space Complexity:** $O(\text{max\_sum})$
    We store the frequency of digit sums. For $n \le 10^4$, the maximum digit sum is 36, so the space complexity is constant $O(1)$ relative to $n$ for practical purposes, but strictly $O(\log_{10} n \cdot 9)$ or $O(\text{max digit sum})$.
