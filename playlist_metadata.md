## 🏆 Title
Algorithm Handbook

## 📝 Description
A comprehensive engineering guide to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) on LeetCode.

In this series, we break down complex problems into clean, production-ready solutions using C++ and Python. Each video focuses on:
*   Intuition: Understanding the "why" behind the approach.
*   Optimization: Deep dives into Time & Space complexity.
*   Best Practices: Writing code that would pass a Google/FAANG code review.

Whether you're prepping for coding interviews or sharpening your engineering skills, this handbook is your essential reference.
